            <p class="section__paragraph">
                Ben's Honey Farm is owned and run by our family.<br> Sebastian and Damian are Polish beekeepers.
                The're
                both
                have great passion for bees.
                The adventure with bees started when Sebastian was a little boy. His grandfather was a beekeeper
                when he
                took
                him to his apiary. Sebastian have loved that since first minute, therefore later he decided to
                finish
                beekeeping
                school and
                then University.<br> During the school years he was working with bees in Germany. It was very hard
                work,
                but the
                hard work made hime
                to learn fast. The time in Germany was a fantastic experience and one that he will never forget.<br>
                When he
                came to Scotland he didn't set up apairy straight away. Few years later he have opened buisness with
                selling beekeeping equipment only, along with his friend. But that was not what he was
                dreaming about, therefore he decided to set up his own bee farm. At first Sebasirian started with 20
                beehives,
                and now he owns and maintain 180 beehaives along with Damian.<br> The
                apiary is getting bigger and bigger every year.

                    On our farm we are working with two types of bees: Buckfast bee and Carniolan bee. Both of them
                    are extremely gentle with low sting instinct. They are perfect for Scotland because they are
                    doing very well in cold/wet days. Both are good honey producer and really "hard workers".

                Bees were one of the first insects that humans domesticated and started farming. Nowadays, one third
                of
                the food
                on your table needs bees to help produce it. Bees play an enormous part in people's lives even if
                they
                don't eat
                honey.<br> Beekeeping is part art and part science and takes a long time to master. It takes
                long
                time to
                learn to determine and understand what really is going on inside the beehive. We know all about bees
                and
                our long
                experience can show you
                interesting things about beehive and bees iteself, without the risk of getting stung!<br> Our beehives
                are
                located on
                different farms in Aberdeenshire. Our bees pollinate local oil-seeds rape and also
                Scottish heather for the production of pure and real honey.

                nectar back to
                their
                hives in special
                honey-tummy tanks. In the hive, nectar becomes honey.
