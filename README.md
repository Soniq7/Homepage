# Homepage

Hi!

Introducing my first webpage (demo version) - it's still being worked on.

## Description

Homepage is based on my husband's beekeeping business in UK called *Ben's Honey Bee Farm* and consists of three sections:

- **About us** - with short description of the business, its beginnings and experience
- **Bee Farm** - introduses: importance of bees, company's focus, and beekeeping products on offer
- **Contact us** - company contact details and Feacebook page for those further interested.



Below link to demo version -  you are very welcome to view and explore the code :)
